# JupyterKernelManager

A C# library that allows you to run locally installed Jupyter kernels and interact with them to execute code and return results.

_This is currently in a pre-release state.  It is able to demonstrate proof of concept, but does not include all necessary features or error checking._

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, and open `JupyterKernelManager/JupyterKernelManager.sln`.  This will load the library project (`JupyterKernelManager`), the unit tests (`Tests`), as well as a simple command line test program (`LocalTest`).


### Prerequisites

This project has only been tested with .NET 4.5.1 on the Windows operating system.  It assumes you have Visual Studio 2017 or higher (this will work with Community Edition)

### Installing

Open the solution in Visual Studio where you want to incorporate Jupyter kernel functionality.  See [StatTag](https://github.com/StatTag/StatTag) for an example project.

Right click on your solution, and select `Add -> Existing project...`.  Navigate to `JupyterKernelManager/JupyterKernelManager` and add `JupyterKernelManager.csproj` to the solution.  You can now add JupyterKernelManager as a dependency to your solution.


### Using the Library

#### Listing the installed kernels

The `KernelSpecManager` class will handle finding and enumerating the installed kernels on your system.  The following code snippet will retrieve a list of `KernelSpec` objects that represent the kernels you have installed.

```
var manager = new KernelSpecManager();
var kernelSpecs = manager.GetAllSpecs();
Console.WriteLine("Enumerating all kernels");
foreach (var kernelSpec in kernelSpecs)
{
	Console.WriteLine("   Found {0} at {1}", kernelSpec.Key, kernelSpec.Value.ResourceDirectory);
}
```

If you have a kernel installed, but it is not showing up in the list returned from `GetAllSpecs`, you may need to explicitly register your kernel in the user directory.  From the command line on your system, run the following command (the example is for the MATLAB kernel):

```
python -m matlab_kernel install --user
```

#### Connecting to a kernel
To interact with the kernel, you can circumvent the `KernelSpecManager`, and use the `KernelManager` class directly.  The `KernelManager` class handles all of the identification and launching of one specific kernel.  Once you have created a `KernelManager` object, you can use it to create a `KernelClient`.  This object allows you to send and receive messages from the kernel.  The following example shows basic initialization of a `KernelClient` for [IRKernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).

```
using (var kernelManager = new KernelManager("ir"))
{
	kernelManager.StartKernel();
	var client = kernelManager.CreateClient();
	client.StartChannels();

	// Send a simple R command to be run
	client.Execute("x <- 100; x");

	// Wait until all of our code has been executed
	while (client.HasPendingExecute())
	{
		Thread.Sleep(500);
	}

	client.StopChannels();

	// Now echo out everything returned by the kernel
	var executeLog = client.ExecuteLog.Values.OrderBy(x => x.ExecutionIndex);
	foreach (var entry in executeLog)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Item {0} ------------------------------------------", entry.ExecutionIndex);
		Console.WriteLine(entry.Request.Content.code);
		Console.WriteLine();

		var dataResponse = entry.Response.FirstOrDefault(
			x => x.Header.MessageType.Equals(MessageType.DisplayData) || x.Header.MessageType.Equals(MessageType.Stream));
		if (dataResponse == null)
		{
			Console.WriteLine("  ( No data returned for this code block )");
		}
		else
		{
			Console.WriteLine(dataResponse.Content);
		}
		Console.WriteLine("--------------------------------------------------\r\n");
	}
}
```
